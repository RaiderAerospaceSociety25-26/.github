# Raider Aerospace Society 25-26 🚀

Welcome to the official GitHub organization for the **Raider Aerospace Society** at Texas Tech University (2025–2026 team).  
We design, build, and test rocketry systems for the **IREC Competition** in the 10k SRAD category.

## 🌌 Projects

We maintain separate repositories for each major subsystem:

- **[srad-flight-computer](https://github.com/RaiderAerospaceSociety25-26/srad-flight-computer)**  
  Custom avionics system (PCB + firmware) that integrates sensors, logging, servo-driven airbrakes, and recovery logic.

- **[tracking-groundstation](https://github.com/RaiderAerospaceSociety25-26/tracking-groundstation)**  
  Dual-link RF ground station for telemetry and live video, including antenna tracking and operator interface.

Other supporting repos will be added as the year progresses.

## 🧑‍💻 How We Work

- All tasks are tracked as **Issues**, organized into **Projects** for each subsystem.
- Work follows a consistent cycle: **Issue → Branch → Pull Request → Review → Merge**.
- Contributions must pass CI (PlatformIO builds, hardware checks, etc.) and be approved by Code Owners.
- See each repo’s [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](./) for full workflow details.

---

## 📚 Documentation

- Contribution guides and workflow docs are under each repo’s `docs/` folder.
- Issues use templates (bug, feature, docs, research) to ensure clarity and consistency.
- See [Issue Guide](https://github.com/RaiderAerospaceSociety25-26/srad-flight-computer/tree/main/docs/ISSUE_GUIDE.md) for how to request work.
